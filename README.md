### Relationship graph: Relationship between Weight and Hindfoot in Female Neotoma albigula w/ best fit line
#In order to determine if there was a correlation with higher weight (g) and longer hind-foot length (mm) a scatter plot graph looking at their relationship was designed 

### Distribution graph: Rodent (Dipodomys merriami) hindfoot length (mm)
#To elucidate the distribution of Dipodomys merriami hind-foot length a histogram was created

### Comparison Graph: sex and month only looking at 1981 look at genus and species Dipodomys spectabillis
